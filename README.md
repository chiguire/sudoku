# Haskell Sudoku

This is just me tinkering with Haskell in order to procude code that is able to
read a Sudoku solution and determine whether it's correct or not. It's also able,
in the case it's not correct, to point out where the error is.

Possible future of this repository: a Sudoku solver, a UI for introducing this information.
